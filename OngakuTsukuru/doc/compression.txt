818A44 - Code - Decompression ($00 = Source Addr, $03 = Dest Addr)

Reads 2 bytes from source, constantly shifts right, uses carry
    0b1 = COPY next byte from source to dest
    0b10 = read next 2 bytes from source (0bNNNNNNNN NNNNNPPP)
            USE 0b111NNNNN NNNNNNNN as relative signed address
            if 0bPPP = 0 then read next byte 0xMM from source
                if 0xMM = 0 then STOP
                if 0xMM = 1 then COPY 2 bytes from relative dest addr
                else then COPY 0xMM+1 bytes from relative dest addr
            else then COPY 0bPPP+2 bytes from relative dest addr
    0bXY00 = read next byte 0xMM from source
            USE 0xFFMM as relative signed address
            COPY 0bYX + 2 bytes from relative dest addr
If running out of bits, read the next 2 bytes from source and continue shifting right
